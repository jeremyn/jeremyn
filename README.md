Hi, my name is Jeremy Nation.

My email address is jeremy@jeremynation.me.

Here are some highlights of what I've done on GitHub:

My largest external involvement was as a volunteer for the [HTTPS Everywhere](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere) browser extension from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) from 2016 to 2018. During that time I merged over 1,000 pull requests from other users, contributed over 150 pull requests, and participated in discussions with other users, volunteers and EFF staff.

My highest-quality personal project is [Simple Ebook Manager](https://github.com/jeremyn/simple-ebook-manager), a collection of CLI utilities written in Python with some SQL.

There are two complete games. The first is [Roguelike Sokoban](https://github.com/jeremyn/roguelike-sokoban), a terminal-based game written in Python, and an homage to the Sokoban levels in the venerable game NetHack. It has some custom levels I wrote, along with levels I adapted from the public domain. You can easily create your own levels by writing them in text files, no coding required.

The second game is [Blocks](https://github.com/jeremyn/blocks), a JavaScript puzzle game with familiar mechanics that you can play in your browser [here](https://jeremyn.github.io/blocks/).

There is also [python-machine-learning-book](https://github.com/jeremyn/python-machine-learning-book), which was my workspace for code taken from the first edition of *Python Machine Learning* by Sebastian Raschka, now in its third edition. I reported various errors in the book to the author which earned me top place on the book's [errata leaderboard](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book/blob/0b68287b40c6f23e47fb1712809e86b53056006c/docs/errata.md#leaderboard).

I also wrote a small Node application [create-report-for-pull-requests](https://github.com/jeremyn/create-report-for-pull-requests) that reports who merged pull requests for a repository on GitHub. I wrote this to count how many pull requests I merged into the HTTPS Everywhere repository.
